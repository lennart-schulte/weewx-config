# weewx-config
My configurations for the weather station software weewx https://github.com/weewx/weewx
These configurations are located in `/etc/weewx`

Own changes:
- `weewx.conf`: add specifics for weather station, location settings, profile setting
- `skins/Current`: the active skin which generates the html pages, changes to which and how information is presented, added pictures dynamically from ilmatietenlaitos.fi
